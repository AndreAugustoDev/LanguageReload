Language Reload is a Fabric mod that speeds up language switching, introduces a search box and multi-selection in 
the language menu and makes item search multilingual.

The mod also adds debug features to cycle languages with **Shift + F3 + J** and to reload them with
**F3 + J** (mostly for developers and translators).
